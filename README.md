# 👋 Hey, I’m Ralph.

I’m a scrappy builder and steady learner — currently diving deep into **Godot + C#**, low-level game systems, and math-based visualizations.

> *“I move fast to explore, then go deep to refine.”*

### 🔧 Projects I’m Exploring

- 🎮 **Godot Platformer** – A Mario Bros–style prototype with patrolling enemies, screen wrap, and custom mechanics using `CharacterBody3D`
- 📐 **Math Playground** – Experiments with vector, plane, and calculus visualizations (targeting graphics + low-level insight)
- 💾 **Atari/NES Programming** – Studying 6502 architecture with a long-term goal of making something rad on real hardware

---

### 🔍 What I’m Into

- Fast prototyping → focused deep work
- Learning by building (and rebuilding)
- Systems thinking, creative tools, visual storytelling
- Staying humble, teachable, and anti-hype

### 🛠️ Tech I Use (or Tinker With)

`Godot` · `C#` · `GDScript` · `Unity (past)` · `Git` · `Figma` · `HTML/CSS`  
Actively learning: `6502 ASM` · `Linear Algebra` · `Calculus`
