# 👋 Hey, I’m Ralph.

I’m a scrappy builder and steady learner — currently diving deep into **Godot + C#**, low-level game systems, and math-based visualizations.

### 🔧 Projects I’m Exploring

- 🎮 **Godot Platformer** – A Mario Bros–style prototype with patrolling enemies, screen wrap, and custom mechanics using `CharacterBody3D`
- 🖌️ **Pixel Paint App** – Basic drawing app made in Godot (Procreate vibes, NES palette)
- 📐 **Math Playground** – Visual experiments in vector math, planes, and calculus
- 💾 **Atari/NES Programming** – Studying 6502 architecture with a long-term goal of building for real hardware
