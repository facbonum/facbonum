# 👋 Hey, I’m Ralph.

I’m a scrappy builder and steady learner — currently diving deep into **Godot + C#**, low-level game systems, and math-based visualizations.

> *“I move fast to explore, then go deep to refine.”*

### 🔧 Projects I’m Exploring

- 🎮 **Godot Platformer** – A Mario Bros–style prototype with patrolling enemies, screen wrap, and custom mechanics using `CharacterBody3D`
- 📐 **Math Playground** – Experiments with vector, plane, and calculus visualizations (targeting graphics + low-level insight)
- 💾 **Atari/NES Programming** – Studying 6502 architecture with a long-term goal of making something rad on real hardware

---

### 🔍 What I’m Into

- Fast prototyping → focused deep work
- Learning by building (and rebuilding)
- Systems thinking, creative tools, visual storytelling
- Staying humble, teachable, and anti-hype

### 🛠️ Tech I Use (or Tinker With)

`Godot` · `C#` · `GDScript` · `Unity (past)` · `Git` · `Figma`  
Creative Tools: `Photoshop` · `Illustrator` · `Procreate (iOS)`  
Web: `HTML/CSS`

### 🔧 Actively Learning

🕹️ **Low-Level & Retro Systems**  
- `6502 ASM` – Atari VCS, NES  
- `Z80 ASM` – Sega Master System, Game Gear  
- `65816 ASM` – SNES  
- `68000 ASM` – Genesis, Sega CD, 32X  
- `HuC6280 ASM` – PC Engine, PC-FX  
- `VB` – Virtual Boy  
- `SH-4 ASM` – Dreamcast

📐 **Math & Visualizations**  
- `Linear Algebra` – for transformations, geometry, and rendering  
- `Calculus` – motion, curves, systems modeling
